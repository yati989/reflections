How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
 was introduced?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
when saving manually it gives us to choose when to save our work so we have apprpriate number of changes
on the other hand it also increases the of forgetting an important commit or making too much commits. 
    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because coding related files often contain related items like functions,methods,variables.so if make a change in one file it will automatically effect other files also
